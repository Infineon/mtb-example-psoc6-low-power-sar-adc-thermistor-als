# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: SAR ADC low-power sensing - thermistor and ambient light sensor

This example demonstrates low-power sensing of a thermistor and ambient light sensor (ALS) using the SAR ADC of PSoC 6 MCU. This code example is supported only for the devices which has SAR ADC capable of operating in System Deep Sleep mode.

Sensor voltages are measured by the SAR ADC while the device is in System Deep Sleep mode resulting in a power-efficient solution.

In the code example, the temperature value in degree celsius and ambient light in percentage are displayed on the UART terminal every half second.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S4 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that following is displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Sensor readings in terminal**

    ![](images/terminal-thermistor-als.png)

5. Touch the thermistor on the board and observe the change in the temperature readings on the terminal.

6. Block or increase the light over the ambient light sensor and observe the change in the percentage readings on the terminal.

7. Confirm that the user LED turns ON when the light over the ambient light sensor is blocked.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

The SAR ADC is configured with three channels - two differential channels for the thermistor and one single-ended channel for the ambient light sensor. The interface circuit and the resources used in the device are shown in Figure 2.

**Figure 2. Sensor interface**

![](images/schematic-thermistor-als.png)

This example demonstrates a low-power sensing solution using the SAR ADC, which is configured to operate in System Deep Sleep mode. That is, while the CPU and other peripherals are turned OFF, the SAR ADC continues to scan the inputs and load the results into the FIFO. Scan is initiated by the timer configured to trigger the SAR ADC at a 400-Hz rate. The CPU wakes up only when the FIFO accumulates the configured number of samples; in this case, after accumulating 120 samples from 40 scans (120 samples / 3 channels). With the timer period of 2.5 ms (1/400), the CPU is woken up every 100 ms (40 x 2.5 ms).

The CPU reads the FIFO data every 100 ms, and passes it through first-order IIR low-pass filter algorithm. The filtered values are used to calculate the temperature in degree Celsius and ambient light intensity in percentage. The user LED is turned ON or OFF depending on the ambient light intensity value. The calculated values of temperature and ambient light intensity are also sent over UART every 500 ms.

**Figure 3. Flowchart**

<br>

**Figure 4. Timing diagram and average current calculation**

![](images/timing-diagram-thermistor-als.png)

The current consumed by the PSoC 6 MCU device can be measured on the kit at the appropriate header. See the kit user guide for details. The bench current measurement for different states of the firmware is shown in Table 1. Note that the thermistor circuit current is excluded from the readings. Current measurement is done by setting the PSoC 6 MCU GPIO, driving the thermistor, to 0. Also, to get current readings for different states, certain modifications done in the *main.c* code as described in Table 1.

**Table 1. Current measurement**

| State  |  Average current   |
| :------- | :------------    |
| Analog resources configured but SAR ADC conversion is not started (timer is disabled). Device is put to System Deep Sleep mode | 8 uA |
| SAR ADC samples the input in System Deep Sleep mode every 2.5 ms, but FIFO interrupt is disabled which causes device to remain in System Deep Sleep mode | 52 uA |
| Normal operation - FIFO interrupt is enabled which causes device to wake up periodically every 100 ms to process the ADC data and transfer the result over UART every 500 ms | 74 uA |
