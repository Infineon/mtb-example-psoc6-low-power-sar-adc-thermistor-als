# PSoC 6 MCU: SAR ADC Low-Power Sensing - Thermistor and Ambient Light Sensor

This example demonstrates low-power sensing of a thermistor and ambient light sensor (ALS) using the SAR ADC of PSoC® 6 MCU. This code example is supported only for the devices which has SAR ADC capable of operating in System Deep Sleep mode. 

Sensor voltages are measured by the SAR ADC while the device is in System Deep Sleep mode resulting in a power-efficient solution. 

In the code example, the temperature value in degree celsius and ambient light in percentage are displayed on the UART terminal every half second.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the Quick Panel. 

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created. 

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps.

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work. 

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command. 

    For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-062S4 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```


4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that following is displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Sensor Readings in Terminal**

    ![Sensor Readings in Terminal](images/terminal-thermistor-als.png)

5. Touch the thermistor on the board and observe the change in the temperature readings on the terminal.

6. Block or increase the light over the ambient light sensor and observe the change in the percentage readings on the terminal.

7. Confirm that the user LED turns ON when the light over the ambient light sensor is blocked.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

The SAR ADC is configured with three channels - two differential channels for the thermistor and one single-ended channel for the ambient light sensor. The interface circuit and the resources used in the device are shown in Figure 2. 
 
**Figure 2. Sensor Interface**

![Sensor Interface](images/schematic-thermistor-als.png)

This example demonstrates a low power sensing solution using the SAR ADC, which is configured to operate in System Deep Sleep mode. That is, while the CPU and other peripherals are turned OFF, the SAR ADC continues to scan the inputs and load the results into the FIFO. Scan is initiated by the timer configured to trigger the SAR ADC at a 400-Hz rate. The CPU wakes up only when the FIFO accumulates the configured number of samples; in this case, after accumulating 120 samples from 40 scans (120 samples / 3 channels). With the timer period of 2.5 ms (1/400), the CPU is woken up every 100 ms (40 x 2.5 ms). 

The CPU reads the FIFO data every 100 ms, and passes it through first-order IIR Low-Pass filter algorithm. The filtered values are used to calculate the temperature in degree Celsius and ambient light intensity in percentage. The user LED is turned ON or OFF depending on the ambient light intensity value. The calculated values of temperature and ambient light intensity are also sent over UART every 500 ms.

**Figure 4. Timing Diagram and Average Current Calculation**
![Timing Diagram and Average Current Calculation](images/timing-diagram-thermistor-als.png)

The current consumed by the PSoC 6 MCU device can be measured on the kit at the appropriate header. See the kit user guide for details. The bench current measurement for different states of the firmware is shown in Table 1. Note that the thermistor circuit current is excluded from the readings. Current measurement is done by setting the PSoC 6 MCU GPIO, driving the thermistor, to 0. Also, to get current readings for different states, certain modifications done in the main.c code as described in Table 1. 

**Table 1. Current measurement**

| State  |  Average Current   |
| :------- | :------------    | 
| Analog resources configured but SAR ADC conversion is not started (Timer is disabled). Device is put to System Deep Sleep mode | 8 uA |
| SAR ADC samples the input in System Deep Sleep mode every 2.5 ms, but FIFO interrupt is disabled which causes device to remain in System Deep Sleep mode | 52 uA |
| Normal operation - FIFO interrupt is enabled which causes device to wake up periodically every 100ms to process the ADC data and transfer the result over UART every 500 ms | 74 uA |
